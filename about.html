  Beginning as Andrew James, Adept garnered quick success with their products and 
  were able to base themselves at Ferryhill in County Durham, before moving to two 
  separate sites in Bowburn (a 10,000 square foot facility and then, an 80,000 
  square foot distribution centre). 
  </p>

  <p>
  Remarkably, the rapid success of the brand took place over a five-year period 
  and during the nationwide recession of 2007-2009.
  </p>

  <p>
  But, with 2012 came the Black Friday phenomenon and the company made 
  approximately £6million.
  </p>

  With each order, however, the business struggled with the workload of 
  distributing a vast amount of items. They simply weren’t prepared for that 
  amount of custom in one day. As Adept, an investment was made in a new 
  distribution centre, to keep up with their growth as a business.
  </p>

  <p>
  Complete with a Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA) service, the distribution centre was a 
  £10million investment that saw the company awarded the Sunday Times Fast Track 
  100 for Effective Use of Capital Award and twice appear in the Virgin Fast Track 
  100 Companies list. 
  </p>

  <p>
  With the distribution centre based in Seaham, Adept has now evolved into an 
  agency that holds Andrew James as one of its affiliate companies, alongside 
  Appkettle, Lekto Wood Fuels and The Grain Store. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Now able to deliver products the whole world over, Adept is aiming to open sites 
  in the US and Asia. In the last 10 years, we have gone from nothing to over 
  £20million and we are always looking for the next challenge.
