  Beginning as Andrew James, Adept garnered quick success with their products 
  and were able to base themselves at Ferryhill in County Durham, before moving 
  to two separate sites in Bowburn (a 10,000 square foot facility and then, an 
  80,000 square foot distribution centre). 
  </p>

  <p>
  Remarkably, the rapid success of the brand took place over a five-year period 
  and during the nationwide recession of 2007-2009.
  </p>

  <p>
  But, with 2012 came the Black Friday phenomenon and the company made 
  approximately £6million.
  </p>

  <p>
  It was clear, however, that a slicker operation when distributing goods was 
  required and in 2017, Adept moved into a new site in Seaham, County Durham. 
  The aim was to keep up with their own growth as a business.
  </p>

  <p>
  The move was a great success.
  </p>

  <p>
  A £10million investment, saw the company awarded the Sunday Times Fast Track 
  100 for Effective Use of Capital Award and twice appear in the Virgin Fast 
  Track 100 Companies list.
  </p>

  <p>
  With the distribution centre based in Seaham, Adept has now evolved into an 
  agency that holds Andrew James alongside other partnering companies. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Adept is passionate about helping other businesses rise from start-up status 
  to becoming fully established brands, identifying the importance of moving 
  from B2B to a B2C level along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
  Proud to be based in the heart of the North East, Adept offers a prompt and 
  professional service, delivering products the whole world over.
