    With a productive warehouse storage management process, Adept Fulfilment ensures your goods are treated with professional care and consideration.

    From the moment your items arrive at Adept, our qualified and experienced team are on hand to store them, regardless of whether they are palletised or not. 

    If your inventory already includes palletised items, they are immediately wrapped, scanned onto our own index and LC labelled. This procedure allows our experts to track each individual pallet. With state-of-the-art technology, they are then stored in their designated part of the larger bulk area.

    If your inventory includes loose items, our dedicated team offer  a re-working service, securely boxing and palletising your stock. This is not only a health and safety procedure, but it also makes your goods easier to transport.

    Adept Fulfilment offer a tailored service, including the option to store your items in a specific area.  
    There is also the opportunity for you to use our modern storage unit.This provides an extra security option and is designed to be beneficial for companies who deal in specialist goods, such as foodstuffs or highly valuable technical equipment. This area is available with full audits.
    With full attention charges, we can also offer specific experts to handle your inventory, meaning you will only have to correspond with one individual. That specialist operative will be the only member of the Adept team to handle your goods and will provide a time-saving service.

    Once our specialist equipment transports your products to the bulk area, our Jungheinrich VNA trucks load them onto pickshelves. Using high-technology wire guidance and with the potential to be fully automated, our VNAs take the stress out of the process and allow more goods to be stored by Adept. Our experts are on hand to ensure your products are stored as effectively as possible, with larger items on the ground floor and smaller items kept on their own level. This is to ensure swift and seamless distribution.

    As well as two wrapping machines, scanners and LC label equipment, Adept provides biodegradable packaging and a Quality Control testing area.
    There are additional offices and meeting rooms and our team are on hand to complete in-depth reports on your stock, as well as pick reports and keep you updated with any product damages and returns. A waste report, in keeping with Environmental Health and Safety procedures can also be provided. 

    Adept Fulfilment allows you to identify the priorities for your company. A flexible storage solution means stock can be rotated to ensure quicker and more accurate distribution. 
    Furthermore, our cutting edge technology means a more effective inventory management, permitting you to be aware of each and every item within the warehouse. 


    A flexible but competitive pricing structure means that, should you need to reduce or increase the amount of Adept warehouse space you require, a flexible pay scale can be applied to ensure you get the best possible storage deal for you and your products.

    With Adept Fulfilment, you get an effective picking and packing system that makes sure your products are organised in the most efficient way to keep your business flowing progressively.


    Once your items have been ordered by a customer, our team will efficiently pick the item (or items) from one of five levels of the pick tower. 

    Having been scanned on their arrival at Adept, your products will be selected by our team with the use of Jungheinrich VNA trucks. This also allows your inventory to be updated immediately. 

    At Adept, we believe in delivering an efficient picking service. That’s why we apply Key Performance Indicators to ensure the best-selling of your items are placed closer to our loading bay, so that their order to distribution time is as quick as possible. 
    We do not believe in a one-size-fits-all process and at Adept, we are proud to tailor our service to individual brands. 
    That is why we are able to provide each company that works with us as much space as they need.

    In correlation with specific trade orders, Adept Fulfilment are fully compliant with Amazon, DPD and Royal Mail packing requirements, ensuring all paperwork is correct. Our team leaders are also proficient in ensuring accurate labels and documents are in place. This is a time-saving practise that allows your business to be liked and respected by your customers.

    Once an item (or items) has been selected, they are moved onto a conveyor belt that transports them towards the loading bay. There, an expert ensures they are matched with any other corresponding items from the same order.  

    Our fully trained and experienced staff are ready to deliver a quality storage solutions system that allows your goods to be safely stocked and prepared to be dispatched as promptly as it can be.

    At Adept Fulfilment, we are extremely proud of the efficient service we provide. Fully committed, we have everything in place to distribute goods as promptly as possible. 

    Once your items have reached the loading bay from our picking and packing service, they are parcelled quickly and safely, before being scanned to ensure they are tracked on their way towards your customers.

    From there, they are moved to the sortation area, where our experts can ensure that, wherever your items are being delivered to, they are going to the correct place, whether it is on a local, national or an international stage.

    Believing in big business, Adept also has dedicated team members on hand to ensure multiple orders are distributed at the same time. With your customers’ best interests at heart, we pride ourselves in ensuring their time and money is not wasted.

    Before they leave us, our staff inspect your products for damages and quality control. We then pack your items and scan them (either with the manual or overhead scanner) to ensure our inventories are up to date

    Our loading area contains 10 loading bays and 2 shutters, as well as a specialised area used to store spare parts for more popular items. We believe that this use of space is a streamlined and an altogether more effective way of using Adept.

    As your items leave us, you do have an option to collect and deliver them yourself. However, if you are to use a courier, our specialist warehouse vehicles are able to drive your pallets onto the delivery van. 

    For any items that may be leaving the European Union, we also provide a shipping service, which allows the correct documents, such as labels and invoices, to be completed fully. 

    Adept Fulfilment also provides an onsite Logistics Coordinator, who can provide you with an estimated date of arrival for your items, as well as all of the necessary reports and responses needed for overseas deliveries. They can even organise the re-delivery of items, should they be misplaced.

    The team at Adept are committed to ensuring that your products are distributed safely and quickly to your customers. We are dedicated to helping your brand maintain its following and we strive to ensure the service we provide is prompt and professional.

    When customers have a change of heart and clients change their mind, it’s imperative to have a procedure in place to ensure that the situation is resolved quickly and satisfactorily for both parties.

    Adept Fulfilment is on hand to help your company establish a professional Returns Management process that includes those items being instantly palletised on arrival.

    Our dedicated team then inspects them thoroughly, deciding on whether they are faulty, damaged or just unwanted. They also ensure that any customer information is removed, as part of our rigorous safeguarding procedure.

    The returned items are then placed in our designated quarantined area in the warehouse, where they will remain until your own investigation is complete. 

    As Adept are committed to the development of companies, we cannot allow returned goods to stay onsite, as long-term storage. Therefore, there will be an additional waste service charge for those companies who do not clear their returned goods.
